This is the server side application for the ICMP C2 project. The server will sniff ICMP packets and listen for the data payload of "What shall I do master?". If this data is received, a command is sent to the client. Command must start with "run"

TODO:
* Build sleep functionality
* Build shell functionality
* Build data exfil functionality
